# Unit-Us

Unit-us is a modern HR SaaS platform designed to help companies manage their Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives. It allows HR administrators to create volunteer events, invite employees, and track participation. To drive engagement, the system includes a gamified "Benefits" engine where employees earn points for participating, which can be redeemed for HR rewards (e.g., Paid Time Off). The application utilizes a rigorous multi-database tenancy architecture to guarantee strict data isolation between client companies.
